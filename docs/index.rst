``Marine Quality Control`` documentation
----------------------------------------

.. include:: ./description.rst

It was developed from the quality control system developed at the Met Office and used in the production of
the `HadSST4`_, `HadISDH`_, and `HadNMAT2`_ datasets and is used in the Copernicus Climate Change Service for
the quality control of in situ marine observations.

The quality control routines have been extracted individually so that they can be used and reused in a more
modular way via a standardised interface.
